Short Guardian Takedown Crystal Charge
======================================

Drastically shortens the time required to charge the crystal pads during
Takedown at the Guardian Breach, on Minos Prime.

There are two variants available for this mod:

1. The "Regular" variant makes the initial two pads (only used during the
   very first mission run) complete in about 2-4 seconds, and the "real"
   ones complete in about 6-10 seconds, depending on how long they've been
   left to decay.
2. The "Instant" variant drops all pretense and just makes the pads complete
   basically as soon as someone steps on them.

The mods also remove the scaling which ordinarily occurs when multiple players
are running the Takedown, and removes the initial charge delay.  When the
pads aren't being occupied, they will decay at their usual rate.
