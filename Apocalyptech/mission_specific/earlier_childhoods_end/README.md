Earlier Childhood's End
=======================

Allows the mission "Childhood's End" to be picked up prior to entering
Konrad's hold (specifically once Blood Drive has been completed), and
unlocks the full mission-intro dialogue if picked up from the water
purifier in Devil's Razor.  The mission-pickup point in Konrad's Hold
remains valid, and will still skip to the appropriate quest objective.

TODO
====

What I *wanted* to do for the mission unlock is to have it available once
Vaughn kicks open the gates to Konrad's Hold, but the game object just
doesn't seem to be willing to update the mission dependency if I keep it
"inside" the same mission it already depended on.  So, the mission just
unlocks as soon as Blood Drive is complete.  That's a bit earlier than I'd
ideally like, but not by a lot.
