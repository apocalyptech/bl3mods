Transaction-Packed: Abridged
============================

Skips basically all of the Desolation's Edge side mission
"Transaction-Packed," and removes all quest dialogue.  The only
objective will be to destroy the final portal!

It's not recommended to activate this mod while you've already got
this quest active.
