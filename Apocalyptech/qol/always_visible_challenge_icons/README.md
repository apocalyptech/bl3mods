Always Visible Challenge Icons
==============================

This mod attempts to make all challenge icons (Claptrap salvages, Radios, etc)
always appear on the map, regardless of if you've been close to them.  It does
the same for Eridian Writings.  Note that you will miss dialog if you use this:
when entering a new map, only one of the available challenge intros will be
played.  This mod supports the base game, DLC2, DLC3, and DLC4.  It does *not*
handle any DLC1 challenges because they act weirdly, and don't respond to the
same techniques used for everything else.

NOTE: The DLC2 challenges Gaige's Gifts and Eldritch Statues don't start
showing up until you've gotten through specific plot events, so don't be
surprised if they're not there directly from the start.

TODO
====

- Would love to figure out the weird DLC1 challenges.
