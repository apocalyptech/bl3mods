Easy Entry to Fort Sunshine
===========================

Adds a door-opening lever to the outside of Fort Sunshine, in Floodmoor Basin.
During the game plot, you'll still need to ride the lumber conveyors into the
fort in order to make progress, but the interior will be much easier to access
outside of that mission.

**Compatibility Note:** This mod *requires* either OpenHotfixLoader or
B3HM v1.0.2 (or greater) to work properly.  Note that as of time of the
mod release, B3HM v1.0.2 has not yet been released, so OHL is the only
supported way to run the mod until then.

**Compatibility Note 2:** This mod will *not* be compatible with any other
mod which adds another of the same type of switch in Floodmoor Basin.  (At
time of writing, no such other mod exists, though, and I'd be a bit surprised
if one popped up in the future).
