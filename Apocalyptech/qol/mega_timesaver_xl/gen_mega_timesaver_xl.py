# There's a lot going on in this mod, but in general there's just a few classes
# of tweaks that I'm making.  This should cover like 95% of the mod.  Here's a
# brief summary:
#
#  - ParticleSystems
#    There's a few cases where a ParticleSystem might determine the timing of
#    something, and others where it just ends up looking weird if you don't
#    speed it up.  Digistruct effects tend to use these, and stuff like the
#    steam while Barista Bot pours coffee in Metridian Metroplex, or the liquid
#    pouring in the brewery in Cankerwood.  There's a lot of values which need
#    to be tweaked to speed up a ParticleSystem -- I've got that wrapped up in
#    a `scale_ps()` function.
#
#  - AnimSequences
#    These are little individual bits of animations, and if that's all you've
#    got to work with, they tend to require a number of tweaks inside them to
#    get the timing right.  I'm using an `AS()` class to wrap all that up.  There's
#    some weird interactions between the majority of the attrs and the
#    `SequenceLength` inside the AnimSequence which I've never figured out.  Some
#    AnimSequences end up glitching out if you scale SequenceLength along with
#    everything else, but others require you to scale it if you want the overall
#    timings to update properly.  Go figure.  The vehicle-related animations in
#    particular are very finnicky, and I've had to balance between an animation
#    which seems to freeze up versus having it *look* fine but leave the vehicle
#    uncontrollable for a bit afterwards.  Note that the AS class expects you to
#    fill in `scale` and `seqlen_scale` *after* instantiation, due to how we're
#    processing these.
#
#  - InteractiveObjects
#    Most of the stuff you interact with in the game is an InteractiveObject (IO),
#    sometimes prefixed by "Blueprint" (BPIO).  Speeding these up requires hitting
#    a lot of internal attrs (much like AnimSequences), but at least these don't
#    suffer from the same weird SequenceLength problems that AnimSequences do.  For
#    some objects, in addition to tweaking the "main" IO object itself, the
#    map-specific instances of the IO might also need some tweaking to account for the
#    reduced runtime.  So you'll see a bunch of level-specific object types have an
#    IO tweak and then also some custom map tweaks further down in the file.  Scaling
#    for these objects is helped out a bit by an `IO()` class, though the actual
#    scaling's done outside the class.
#
#  - GbxLevelSequenceActors
#    As a potential alternative to both AnimSequence and InteractiveObject tweaking,
#    the game sometimes uses sequences to kick off one or more of those, and there
#    may be a GbxLevelSequenceActor which kicks that off.  I didn't really discover
#    these until pretty late in the mod development, but when they're available,
#    they seem much more reliable (and simpler!) than editing AnimSequence and
#    InteractiveObject objects directly.  They've got a `SequencePlayer` sub-object
#    attached which has a very convenient `PlayRate` attr, so all I need to do is
#    set that and I'm golden.  I suspect there are quite a few AS/IO tweaks
#    that I'm doing which would be better done via this method.  (I'm pretty sure
#    there are plenty of AS/IO objects which don't live inside a sequence, so we'd
#    have to be doing some direct tweaks anyway, though.)
#
#  - Bytecode Tweaks
#    Finally, the other main class of tweaks in here is altering blueprint bytecode,
#    generally just to shorten `Delay` opcodes.  There's plenty of times where even
#    if you have all the AS/IO/whatever stuff sped up, you'll end up with blueprint-
#    enforced delays.  Tracking these down is a "fun" process sometimes; see my
#    UAssetAPI fork: https://github.com/apocalyptech/UAssetAPI/
#
# Other than all that, there's the usual amount of "custom" tweaking for other
# stuff, which should be pretty straightforward so long as you've got object
# serializations available.  Elevators all share a common set of attrs, as do the
# NPC walk/sprint speed stuff.  I've tried to keep things at least somewhat
# commented, so hopefully the comments here will help out if you're curious about
# something!

    Function to attempt to scale all components of a ParticleSystem object.
    At time of writing, this is hardly being used by anything -- I'd written
    it for Typhon's digistruct animation in Tazendeer Ruins, and it turns
    out that maybe we didn't even have to (the critical timing tweak looks
    like it was probably an ubergraph bytecode change to the call to his
    dialogue line).  Anyway, we've got a few other instances of editing
    ParticleSystems in here, which should maybe get ported over to using
    this, once I've got an opportunity to re-test 'em.

    `mod` and `data` should be the relevant Mod and BL3Data objects.

    `hf_type` and `hf_target` should be the initial hotfix params -- so far,
    we've only needed Mod.LEVEL for `hf_type`.

    `ps_name` is the path to the ParticleSystem object

    `scale` is the scale to use ("scale" is actually kind of a bad name here;
    we're actualy dividing, not multiplying)

    `notify` can be passed in to set the notify flag on the hotfixes, too,

    I suspect that a lot of our AnimSequence tweaks that we do via this class would

# Vault Card Chest injection!  So: the Vault Card menu uses a custom red chest

# menu has been opened, though, and they disappear once the menu is closed.  So,
# our hotfixes can't touch them unless we inject the chest into each map first.
# So that's what we're doing here!  One further wrinkle is that the "stock" custom
# red chest object doesn't actually use the animation that the menu-spawned chest
# uses, so we *also* have to force that reference to exist, so that we can hotfix
# the proper animation.  Just 395 hotfixes (including the actual animation-speedup
# ones) to get this working!  Totally worth it.

# So there's various objects in here where we're doing an IO() tweak in this section, but then
# down below we also do some tweaking to a Timeline object, specifically tweaking its Length
# attr, to match up with the freshly-scaled IO() bits.  Well, towards the tail end of this mod
# development, I noticed that those Timeline objects also have a `PlayRate` attr, which
# simplifies this whole process -- namely, you can leave this IO() bit out, leave the Timeline
# `Length` how it is, and *just* alter the `PlayRate`.  I suspect I may not have the energy
# to convert all the prior stuff to do it, so I think this new method is likely to only be
# used for some of DLC2 and then DLC3.  Still, it might be worth converting it at some point.
# (To be fair, *most* of the IOs in here make sense to keep as they are -- it's mostly just the
# mission-related objects in the "Other" section which ended up requiring map-specific tweaks.
# We wouldn't want to have to touch every single map door object to alter PlayRate, etc.  It
# should be mostly just the ones where I've noted that there's extra tweaks "below.")

# While working on speedups for Oletta, there was one annoying sequence at the
# beginning of the Lost and Found mission where her stance was unavoidably locked
# to "Walk" instead of sprint, and she had a *long* way to go, requiring a pretty
# hefty Walk-speed buff to make it reasonable.  Unfortunately, it seems that NPCs
# might not actually use MaxSprintSpeed -- it seems that the game probably just
# scales up MaxWalkSpeed instead, which led to pretty absurd behavior elsewhere in
# Oletta's movements.
#
# So, one thing I'd been doing for awhile was to convert as many of her Run stances
# to Walk, to attempt to compensate for this.  The one place I was aware of where
# this was more-or-less *necessary*, to avoid skipping dialogue, was her initial
# jaunt over to the lab, to charge up the core sample to activate the Menta Gnats.
#
# I'd ended up trying it on *all* the stance parameters that I could find, in the
# end, because her sprint speed was hilariously out of place otherwise, but all of
# this combined ended up causing some really bizarre behavior.  On the way to the
# test area (where you first use Traitorweed), she ends up teleporting a bit, and
# the dialogue triggers are a bit weird.  Then afterwards she seems to say some
# dialogue *early* and open the door to the rest of the level from a distance.
#
# In the end, what I did instead of this was move her navigation AINodes around a
# bit -- she runs from her spawnpoint to the dedicated spot -- and bringing her
# walk speed buff down to our usual levels, and that turned out to be a much better
# solution overall.  Still, leaving this in here in case I want to take another
