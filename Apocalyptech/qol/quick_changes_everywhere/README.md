Quick Changes Everywhere
========================

Introduces a Quick Change station to every level in the game which
didn't already have one.  Many thanks to CZ47 for the Slaughters
and Trials / Proving Grounds locations!

**NOTE:** This mod requires either B3HM v1.0.2 (which, as of October
2nd, 2022, has not been released yet), or apple1417's OpenHotfixLoader.
This mod will *not* with with B3HM v1.0.1 or lower!

The Quick Change placements should in general be pretty obvious, and
placed around the "main" Fast Travel location in each map.  Some larger
maps have more than one station placed, and a couple might have the
station in a less-than-obvious location.  Here's the ones which might
be slightly less obvious, or where there's more than one per map:

- **Devil's Razor:** station in both Boomtown and Roland's Rest.  The
  Roland's Rest station is tucked away in one of the buildings.
- **Splinterlands:** station at the Chop Shop, and at the Homestead
- **Lectra City:** station near the entrance, and near Moxxi's Bar
- **Skywell-27:** station near the entrance, and down in the lower level
- **Atlas HQ:** the single station is found in Rhys's office
- **Neon Arterial:** the single station is found in the Transit Station,
  about halfway through the level.
- **Floodmoor Basin:** station at both Knotty Peak and Reliance
- **Ambermire:** station near the entrance, and at Rogue's Hollow
- **Desolation's Edge:** the single station is in Typhon's hideout
- **The Spendopticon:** the single station is in Timothy's hideout
- **Impound Deluxe:** station near the entrance, and at Beggar's Berth
- **Skittermaw Basin:** station near the gondola Catch-A-Ride, and
  the Clan Amourette fast travel.
- **Cursehaven:** the single station is in Lantern's Hook, the town
  where Burton's office is.
- **Heart's Desire:** the single station is near the "What Beats
  Beneath" fast travel, about halfway through the level
- **Ashfall Peaks:** stations both at the entrance and at the Caldera
  Stronghold fast travel
- **The Blastplains:** the single station is at the Pump & Change
  fast travel.
- **Obsidian Forest:** the single station is at Crone's Contentment
- **Bloodsun Canyon:** stations both at the entrance, and at the
  Presentation Room

Let me know if you've got any alternate placements for these which you
think might make sense, either as an alternative to what I have in here
or as an addition.

**Compatibility Note:** This mod will *not* be compatible with any other
mod which adds in Quick Change stations to the same levels.
