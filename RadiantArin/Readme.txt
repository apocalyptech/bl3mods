CHANGELOG:

• Increased Heavy weapon damage by 0.25.

• Hyperion Shotgun Damage was decreased by 5%.

• Maliwan Pistol damage was increased by 5%.

• Tediore E-Tech barrels were being double dipped with the new changes to E-Tech weapons. These have been reverted.

• Ruby's Wrath damage was reduced to 2.2 from 2.5.

• Globetrotter damage was increased to 2.5 from 2.0.

• Kaos damage was reduced to 1.75 from 1.875.

• Boomer was fixed.

• Gold Rush damage was increased to 1.638 up from 1.365.

• Hyperfocus XZ41 damage increased to 1.5 from 1.4.

• Blade Fury damage decreased from 1.6 to 1.072.

• The Love Thumper was removed from the modpack. Coincidentally, this means bringing back the OPQ. Yay! :)

CHARACTER CHANGES:

Moze:

• Matched Set and Experimental Munitions buffs were reverted.

• Click Click was changed to the following: "Moze gains dramatically increased Gun Damage on the first shot of a fully loaded magazine. Does not work with COV weapons." The reason for this change is that Click Click originally did not fit in with Moze's skill tree, and it was primarily a useless skill. Now, it serves more purpose in her tree and has actual use, especially with the class mods that now boost it. The scaling for Click Click has been increased to 40% per level now to make room for the new text.

Amara:

• Replaced Mindfulness Shield Recharge Delay with Gun Damage.

• From Rest replaces Charge Time with Magazine Size.

• Tempest Gun Damage was reverted from V1 back to its original Gun Damage. Some other skills that work the same way have been reverted as well.

• Updated the World Drop Legendary pool with the new weapons. If it specifically does not say on the Wiki that it world drops, then it will not world drop.

• Fixed a bug with GeneVIV's drop pools.

• Fixed a bug with Pain and Terror (or more appropriately, Agonizer 9k) dropping the Kitten still.

• Increased Looter Psycho's drop chances for Legendary gear.

• Adding Manufacturer Infos back to Anointed Gear. The most annoying part of Anointed Gear was that it took away some much needed information regarding Manufacturer Texts, like Vladof Sniper Rifles, or how many shots a Shotgun has on its Underbarrel. This has been fixed. 


1.1.0

• Decreased Shock damage on armor to its original value of 75% on NVHM, and 50% on TVHM.

• Lowered Hyperion Shotgun damage bonus from 1.3 to 1.2.

• Snowdrift and Toboggan Slide Speed nerfs were removed.

• Increase the damage of the Bodyguard SMG by 22%.

• Taken out the Moxxi's Blood Rush artifact. Upon further notation and advice from the community, it was a poorly executed, better version of an already existing Artifact, the Holy Grail. Therefore, the changes to the Blood Rush have been reverted.

• Doubled the damage reduction of the Dragon Class Mod.

• Moze's Minigun Damage has been increased. Minigun 1 Mod (Let off some Steam) was increased by 10%, Minigun 2 Mod (General Winter) was increased by about 5%, and Minigun 3 Mod (Exploding. Bullets.) was increased by 20%. Iron Cub damage was reduced from 0.6 to 0.5.

• Target Softening's Debuff was increased to 25%.

• Amara's Violent Tapestry was changed to deal Status Damage instead of Status Chance.

• Amara's Forceful Expression value was tripled.

• Amara's Phasecast Damage has been increased. Base Phasecast was increased by 25%, Reverberation by 25%, Deliverance by 30%, and Tandava by 32.5%. Amara's Phaseslam Damage has also been increased. Base Phaseslam was increased by 35%, Fracture by 25%, and Downfall by 35%.

• Increased the rate at which you get Legendaries from Red Chests in Arms Race at their dedicated locations (for example Silo, Spaceport, Sewers, etc.). This does not affect global Red Chest values.

1.0.3

• Added a floor in the Slaughterstar 3000 map to prevent Red Rain/Blue Fire's loot from dropping into the void.

• Added Weighted Ammo Drops to the game. The lower you are on a particular item (health or ammo), the more you will receive from chests.

• Changed the way elements work. Before, matching element bonus on NVHM was only 25%. Now it is 50%. TVHM/Mayhem has also been increased by 25%, for a grand total of 75% increased damage. Resistances have stayed the same. Cryo is no longer effective against Shields.

• Completely changed Mayhem! Before, Mayhem 11 was only served to have no mayhem modifiers, but it didn't actually do anything regarding the values of Eridium, Cash, EXP, and Loot Drops. Therefore, all data regarding M11 was replaced with the values for M10, and M11 no longer exists. The curve for loot has also changed substantially regarding this change. The scaling of health, shield, and armor remains the same, at 100% each level.

• Decreased the rate at which badasses spawn in Mayhem/TVHM by 50%.

• Decreased Hemo/Vermi's Health by 50%.

• Tripled the damage of Panoptic Malechars and RPG Loaders to make them high priority targets. More enemies of the same caliber will have increased damage down the line.

• Reverted the Tediore Nerf.

• Increase the damage of the Gold Rush by 30%.

• Increase the damage of the Boomer by 25%. Additionally, increased it's Status Effect Chance and Damage by 10%.

• Increase the damage of the Flama Diddle by 20%.

• Reduce the damage of the Cocky Bastard by 15%.

• Decrease the capacity of the Madcap shield by 20%, but increase its Recharge Rate by the same amount.

• Equalized all Nova Anointments to 2.5.

• Increase the damage of the SNTNL Cryo Anointment to 60% to fit in line with the other character specific Anointments.

• Increase the damage of ALL grenades in the game by 50%.

• Decrease the damage of the Chandelier by 50%.

• Added four new items! These are the Lucent Prism manufactured by Atlas, the Eternal Guardian manufactured by Torgue, the Amalgam Artifact, and the Bonus Package manufactured by Torgue. The Lucent Prism will drop from Hemovorous and Vermivorous on Mayhem 6 or above, the Eternal Guardian will drop from Scourge on Mayhem 6 or above, the Amalgam will drop from Empowered Grawn, and the Bonus Package drops from Ruiner.

1.0.2

• Reduced the health of all enemies in the GTD by 50%.

• Cleaned up a bit of code surrounding quest rewards.

• The O.P.Q. was removed from the game due to the Love Thumper. :(
